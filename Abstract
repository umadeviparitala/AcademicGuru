  Students are facing much inconvenience to get their doubts clarified or to collect pre-requisites and get prepared for any opportunities accordingly. There are many students
who want to know the requirements to attend a workshop, tips or suggestions for exams, pre requirements for any training programs being conducted etc.

  To clear the doubtful mind, we came up with a “STUDENT FORUM” where ideas and doubts are exchanged and clarified respectively. It is a Web Application where students and
faculty get registered. Anyone at any point of time can post their queries in the forum. Faculty registered or senior students or peers can answer the questions posted. The
queries and their answers are viewed by everyone but the chance to post a query or reply to an answer is only for registered users. The platform is for academic purposes only.
